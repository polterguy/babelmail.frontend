        This application was automatically generated with
        <a target="_blank" href="https://polterguy.github.io/">Magic</a>, and
        was based upon the
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://github.com/ngx-rocket/generator-ngx-rocket"
          >generator-ngx-rocket Angular starter-kit</a
        >. The purpose of the app is to serve as an enterprise email
        inbox/outbox, to for instance have a common email address where
        customers and clients can request support, send documents, etc. The
        application is not intended to serve individual email requirements for
        employees, but rather to provide a common email inbox for multiple
        employees, allowing your employees to answer emails sent to common
        support email adress, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The backend can also easily be integrated into any CRM system you wish
        to integrate it with, since it has a rich web API, allowing you to
        associate emails with for instance customers and clients of your
        company. It also allows you to easily create semi-automated email
        functions, such as providing an email address for your CRM system(s),
        and semi-automate processes occurring as your CRM system receives an
        email from a client or an employee. The system stores all sent and
        received emails in an SQL database, which again has a rich web API,
        allowing you to easily query the system, and/or associate emails with
        customers and clients within any other types of systems, that can be
        easily integrated with BabelMail using its web API. The system also
        supports templates, which are pre-defined email templates, that can
        easily be braided in with customer specific data, allowing you to send
        emails based upon templates.
